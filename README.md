# 📊 Multivariate Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of **multivariate statistical techniques** implemented in **R** and **Python**.
This repository brings together clear examples, visualizations, and reports for methods that help uncover patterns, relationships, and structures in complex datasets.

---

## 📂 What’s Inside

* **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – Simplify data by reducing dimensions while keeping most of the information.
* **CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis)** – Explore how two sets of variables are connected.
* **Factor Analysis** – Identify hidden factors influencing your data.
* **DBSCAN Clustering** – Group observations based on density patterns.
* **MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)** – Visualize similarities and distances in fewer dimensions.
* **Correspondence Analysis** – Understand relationships between categorical variables.

Alongside these, you’ll find:

* **R-code** and **Python-code** folders with ready-to-run scripts.
* **R-MarkDown** reports combining code and interpretation.
* **PDF** exports for easy reference.
